The project mainly focused on practicing:
  Building a full CRUD system (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
  Applying the MVC architecture effectively (Models, Views, Controllers).
  Using Entity Framework Core with migrations to manage the database structure and keep it in sync with the models.
  Through this project, I gained solid hands-on experience in connecting Models with the Database, using Views to present data, and organizing the logic in Controllers.
As an additional touch, I enhanced the UI using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to make the design cleaner and more responsive. With my background in front-end, I enjoyed giving the web app a polished look.
